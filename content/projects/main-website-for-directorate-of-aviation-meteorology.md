The Main Website for Directorate of Aviation Meteorology serves as the primary digital portal for Indonesia's aviation weather services, providing comprehensive meteorological information and forecasts for the aviation industry. This platform is the public-facing hub of BMKG's aviation meteorology operations, serving pilots, airlines, airports, and aviation authorities across Indonesia.

## Project Scope & Purpose

This website functions as the central information system for aviation meteorology in Indonesia, consolidating data from over 100 weather observation stations nationwide. It provides critical weather information that directly impacts flight safety, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance for Indonesia's rapidly growing aviation sector.

The platform replaced an older legacy system, modernizing how aviation meteorological services are delivered to stakeholders. It needed to handle diverse user groups with varying technical expertise, from professional meteorologists to airline operations staff and general aviation pilots.

## Core Features & Services

**Aviation Weather Products**: The site delivers a full suite of aviation weather products including METAR/SPECI (current weather observations), TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts), SIGMET (Significant Meteorological Information), and wind/temperature forecasts. Each product follows international ICAO standards for aviation meteorology.

**Weather Warning Systems**: Real-time dissemination of critical weather warnings including SIGMETs for hazardous conditions like thunderstorms, turbulence, and volcanic ash. The system includes Space Weather Advisories for solar radiation events that can affect radio communications and GPS navigation.

**Forecast & Analysis Tools**: Interactive tools for viewing weather forecasts across multiple time horizons. This includes CB (Cumulonimbus) cloud growth potential maps, area-based thunderstorm forecasts, and airport-specific weather predictions. Users can access high-level and medium-level Significant Weather (SigWX) charts used for flight planning.

**Observation Data**: Comprehensive access to current weather observations from all Indonesian airports, synoptic data, upper-air soundings from radiosonde launches, satellite imagery, and radar composites. The data visualization includes interactive maps showing real-time conditions across the archipelago.

**Multilingual Support**: The platform supports both Indonesian and English languages, ensuring accessibility for international aviation operators and foreign airlines operating in Indonesian airspace.

## Technical Implementation

The website is built with a robust architecture designed for high availability and data accuracy. The backend processes multiple real-time data streams from weather stations, satellite feeds, and radar systems, aggregating and formatting this information for web delivery.

**Scalable API Architecture**: The system includes a comprehensive API layer that serves data to both the website frontend and external clients. This API handles authentication, rate limiting, and data validation to ensure reliable service delivery even during peak traffic periods or severe weather events.

**Real-Time Data Processing**: Weather data requires near-instantaneous processing and dissemination. The platform implements automated pipelines that ingest raw meteorological observations, validate them against quality control rules, format them according to international standards, and publish them to the website within minutes of observation.

**High Availability Infrastructure**: Given the critical nature of aviation weather information, the system is designed with redundancy and failover capabilities. Database replication ensures data availability, and caching strategies reduce load during high-traffic periods.

## Operational Impact

Since its launch, the platform has become an essential tool for aviation operations in Indonesia. It serves thousands of daily users including flight dispatchers planning routes, pilots conducting pre-flight weather briefings, and air traffic controllers monitoring conditions for safe aircraft operations.

The website has significantly improved the accessibility and timeliness of aviation meteorological information in Indonesia. By providing a modern, user-friendly interface with reliable data delivery, it supports the nation's aviation industry growth while maintaining high safety standards. The platform handles traffic spikes during severe weather events, when demand for weather information increases dramatically, without service degradation.

The project demonstrates successful digital transformation of critical government services, replacing paper-based and phone-based weather briefings with instant web-based access to comprehensive meteorological data.
