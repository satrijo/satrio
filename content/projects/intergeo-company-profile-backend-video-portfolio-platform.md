Intergeo Company Profile Backend & Video Portfolio Platform is a Laravel-based application that powers the corporate website and media presence of Intergeo, a geospatial and surveying services company. The project provides a robust admin panel and API to manage company profile content, video portfolios, and related media, which are then consumed by the public-facing site.

From a business perspective, the system centralizes how Intergeo presents its brand, services, and project showcases. Admin users can create and update video portfolio entries (including titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and embed links), highlight featured projects, and keep company information up to date without touching code. This makes it much easier for the marketing and operations teams to maintain a professional, consistent online presence.

On the technical side, the backend is built with Laravel (PHP) and follows a clean, RESTful architecture. It implements structured controllers and request validation for all CRUD operations around video portfolios and company content, with pagination and filtering for scalable listing pages. Authentication and authorization are enforced so that only authenticated users with the right roles can access the admin and content management features.

The project also includes an SPA-like admin interface built with Vue.js (via Laravel's frontend tooling and Inertia-style pages), which communicates with the backend through well-defined JSON endpoints. This provides a smooth, responsive UX for managing portfolios, including create/edit forms, validation feedback, and status messages.

The tech stack includes Laravel (PHP 8+), a relational database (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage, Vue.js for the admin UI, and modern tooling for asset bundling. The codebase is organized for maintainability, with reusable components, clear routing, and separation of concerns between domain logic, HTTP layer, and presentation. Overall, this project serves as a solid, production-ready backend foundation for a real-world company profile and video portfolio website.
